# Major Project 4: Insights and Prediction of Growing Suitable Crop

Agriculture makes the people less dependent on foreign countries as it provides food and also provides income to the farmers and revenue to the government. Nepal Agriculture Research Pvt. Ltd. has initiated to help these farmers with suggestions about the best crop that can be grown in their land.

The project objectives are:
- From the given dataset, we need to analyze the different conditions where crops are grown.
- We need to group the list of crops based on the similar condition that they grow in.
- We also need to predict which crop can be grown with which given conditions.

## ðŸ“¦ Setting up the project
```bash
git clone git@github.com:amunamun07/major_project.git
```

After you clone the project. You need to setup the environment.

- **Operating system**: macOS / OS X Â· Linux Â· Windows (Cygwin, MinGW, Visual
  Studio)
- **Python version**: Python 3.9 (only 64 bit)
- **Package managers**: [pipenv]

[pipenv]: https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/

### pipenv

Using pip, we can install the pipenv package manager, make sure that
your `pip`, `setuptools` and `wheel` are up to date. If you already have 
pipenv installed, you can skip the first command.

```bash
pip install pipenv
```
To create a pipenv environment in a folder.
```bash
pipenv shell
```
To get the project requirements.
```bash
pipenv sync
```

### Getting the dataset

To download the dataset into the folder, use:
```bash
weget https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WCpTGIJrHudvWEbRe09dDIAYKJo2GiHo/view?usp=sharing
```

### Getting the model

To download the model for ease, use:
```bash
weget https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q5wvhOCLYTSJxp6R8iRgsAfBnsNay44n/view?usp=sharing
```


## âš’ Run the project

We need to activate both the servers streamlit and flask at once. So one of the way is to run streamlit
in the background and then running the flask app.
Alternatively you can use two subprocesses and manage running both the servers.

```bash
# Run the Streamlit Dashboard in the background
streamlit run dashboard/main.py &

# To run the Streamlit Dashboard not in the background
streamlit run dashboard/main.py

# Now, run app.py
python app.py
```

## ðŸš¦ Run tests

You can run the test files using the command below

```bash
pytest -v
